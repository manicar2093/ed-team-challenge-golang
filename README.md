# Cryptocurrencies Charter

This is the code for ed.tead challenge. It has many errors, but I make this in one nigth xD

## How to run?

It is needed the next Environment variables:
- **FILES_PATH**: Indicates were charts will be saved in the server.
- **NOMICS_KEY**: The key that will be used to communicate with Nomics API

If one of this does not exist a **panic** will be raised indicating wich env variable is missing

**NOTE:** The port to use will be 5000 so make sure you're not using it already.

To run just type in yot terminal:
```
make run
```
or
```
go run main.go
```
And that will be enough

## Comments

Yes, this has failures. I don't know why but the chart image can't be downloaded from Postman. Besides that I feel the code organizations is great and I'd like to have your review :D
